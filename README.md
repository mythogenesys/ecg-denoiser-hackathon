### The Core Innovation: STPC Framework

The central contribution of this project is the **Spectral-Temporal Physiological Consistency (STPC)** framework, a new physics-informed method for training deep learning models on biomedical signals.

Traditional models often fail because they only match a signal's shape, leading to oversmoothing of critical features. The STPC framework teaches the AI the **physics of a real heartbeat** by forcing it to preserve three key properties simultaneously:

1.  **Amplitude Consistency:** The correct voltage and overall shape.
2.  **Temporal-Gradient Consistency:** A custom gradient loss that preserves the sharp, high-velocity spikes of a heartbeat (the QRS complex).
3.  **Spectral-Magnitude Consistency:** An FFT-based loss that ensures the denoised signal has a realistic frequency profile.

This results in a denoised signal that is not just clean, but **physiologically faithful** and trustworthy enough for downstream diagnostic tasks. Our research shows this approach leads to a measurable improvement in arrhythmia classification accuracy.
